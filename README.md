# calculator

This is a project made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this project I made a caculator which can perform some basic stuff of our calculation.
Since, I made this project as a beginner and just leared front-end so there might be some things which you might wanna help me our with.
Please feel free to help me making this project better and your contributions are welcome here.
